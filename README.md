# DS-Algorithms
This is my First GitHub Repository which I created on 15/10/2023. 
This Repo will be having all DSA Programs that I have solved and will be solving. These programs will be mostly in C Language.

This Repository has the Programs to Implement:
1. Circular Queue: circularQueue.c
2. Linked List (Singly Linked): linkedList.c 
3. Graph Data Structure using 2D Array: graph_2dArray.c
4. Graph Data Structure using Linked List: graph_LinkedList.c
5. Finding n^th prime number: nthPrimeNum.c
