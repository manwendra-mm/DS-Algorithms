# DS-Algorithms 
This Repo will be having all DSA Programs that I have solved and will be solving. These programs will be mostly in C Language.

This Repository has the Programs to Implement:
1. Queue: queue.c
2. Stack: [Stack_PushPop.c](https://github.com/manwendra-mm/DS-Algorithms/blob/main/Stack_PushPop.c)
3. Circular Queue: circularQueue.c
4. Linked List (Singly Linked): linkedList.c
5. Double Linked List: doubleLinkedList.c
6. Graph Data Structure using 2D Array: graph_2dArray.c
7. Graph Data Structure using Linked List: graph_LinkedList.c
8. Finding n^th prime number: nthPrimeNum.c
9. pairOfPrime.c
